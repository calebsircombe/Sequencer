# Step Sequencer
Step Sequencer created in Juce/XCode, as an Audio Plug In.

# Features:
- 16 Steps
- 120 Bpm
- Ability to load any sample

# Bugs:
- App will crash if the sample # isn't loaded in first and steps get turned on.
- File has to be a WAV, otherwise the code needs to be adapted to change format to AIF or MP3.

Enjoy!
